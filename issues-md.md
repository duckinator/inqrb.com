The `ISSUES.md` file is used to both explain how the issue tracker is
set up to a project's developers. Inq pulls in information from this
and includes it in the summary, so people don't have to reference a
second document while viewing summaries.

For an example of `ISSUES.md` in practice, you can view [the one for
Inq](https://github.com/duckinator/inq/blob/master/ISSUES.md).
